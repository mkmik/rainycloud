Changes by version:
===================

0.1.1
=====

Using fixed random seed for unit testing
Avoid using babudb as it works only when the partitions are prefix coded. Overhead of reloading csv is low when the job takes 60 secs though.
Added "huge-ranges.txt" file, with few big partitions, so that each job runs for about 1 minute.

0.1.0
=====

using git flow
implement object passing for COMPSs
